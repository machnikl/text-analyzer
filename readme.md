# Word Analyzer
This is a project from Niklas Machacek for Dedalus Healthcare.


The user can type in a word and analyze it either for its vowels or its consonants. The letters are being counted and displayed in the FE using Chart.js.

The user can switch between online and offline mode, switching between the FE and BE word analyzing functions.

## Frontend
The Frontend is build with Angular 13.

### Development server

Run `npm i` to install all necessary dependencies.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng test` to run the unit tests of the frontend.


## Backend
The backend is setup with Spring and Java 8.
The backend server needs to be running for the Frontend to work.
This was the first Java BE Server I ever set up, which results in a very basic approach.
